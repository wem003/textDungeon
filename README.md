Python text Dungeon practice

This is a test project that my son and I did years ago to practice new concepts and I was teaching python to him.

The idea was to start laying down some code to really enforce what we were reading in "Coding for Beginners Using Python" from Usborne.  That book has some simple programs that play with lists and dictionaries and the like, so before we moved on to the graphics section of that book - we thought a simple text adventure could help.

We've made many versions of this, and will continue to iterate as we want to practice a concept - but we've gone from a simple program that reads in some json and does all the game work in a while loop, to refactoring with classes, better JSON, etc.

We worked on this together, so early versions will be sloppy as we try something, and later versions will be cleaner as he and I practice the concepts more.
